edgar_facts.py v4 — SEC EDGAR Company Facts endpoint for the Growth Alpha / Consilium Spine microservice.

First-source XBRL financials (data.sec.gov) for IVC_LIB + scenario_f. Priority tags with fallbacks;
no hit -> null + '_missing'; never fabricate; never throws. EDGAR is primary but NOT flawless
(placeholder zeros, stale period contexts), so this layer adds deterministic SANITY GATES:
  first-source + validation, not blind trust.

v3 fixes (from the ASTS live run):
  A. DROP placeholder zeros in revenue/gross_profit/operating_income. A literal 0 in these for an
     operating company is a filler tag, not a fact — feeding it corrupts CAGR/burn_multiple.
     Dropped years are recorded in _flags.dropped_zero (visible, not silent).
  B. STALE-CONTEXT flag: if a year's value EXACTLY equals another year's AND differs from a
     neighbor by >=3x, it's likely a stale comparative context (ASTS 2024 == 2022 == $13.825M
     next to 2025 == $70.9M). Flagged in _flags.suspect_stale_context — NOT dropped (could be
     legitimate), surfaced for the auditor/you.
  C. shares_current CASCADE: companyfacts(dei) -> companyconcept(dei) -> companyfacts(us-gaap)
     -> companyconcept(us-gaap) -> honest null. ASTS has NO dei block in companyfacts, so the
     separate companyconcept call is required.

v4 addition — CONFIRMED-SPLIT detection (fixes false-positive split application, e.g. PLTR
  2021 2x share jump that was organic SBC/warrant dilution, not a real stock split). A genuine
  split causes RETROACTIVE RESTATEMENT: a later 10-K re-reports an EARLIER fiscal year-end's share
  count at the POST-split value, so the SAME end-date shows two materially different values across
  different accessions/filed-dates whose ratio matches a clean split factor. Organic dilution is
  NEVER retroactively restated -- so this is a positive, SEC-sourced confirmation signal, not a
  heuristic. Exposed as _flags.confirmed_splits: [{end, factor, earliest_val, earliest_filed,
  latest_val, latest_filed}]. Consumers (Growth Enrich) should ONLY apply a clean-ratio jump as a
  real split if the end-date appears here; otherwise treat it as dilution (safer default -- avoids
  retroactively corrupting EPS/per-share series when the "split" was actually dilution).

SCOPE (phase 1): financial facts. Form 4 insider = phase 2.

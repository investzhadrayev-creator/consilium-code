"""Token accounting for a Consilium Spine run. ONE canonical home for prices.

DESIGN, in the house idiom:

  TOKENS ARE FACTS. They come from each provider's own `usage` block, echoed back in the HTTP
  response we already receive and, until v4.2.5, threw away. Nothing is inferred or estimated.

  DOLLARS ARE AN ESTIMATE, and the estimate carries its basis. `_AS_OF` below is the date the
  table was last checked; the report prints it. A price table is a hardcoded number that goes
  stale silently -- the exact defect class this project keeps paying for -- so it is dated,
  sourced, and it EXPIRES loudly.

  A MODEL WITH NO PRICE IS [UNVERIFIED], NEVER $0. A run is never free. Rendering an unpriced
  model as 0.00 would be "unknown spelled zero" and would understate the bill by exactly the
  amount you failed to look up. Unpriced models are named in the report and excluded from the
  total, and the total says so.

PROVENANCE WARNING: the rates below were compiled 2026-07-17 from SECONDARY aggregators, not
from the vendors' own pricing pages (those were not reachable from the build environment). They
are a starting point that the operator MUST verify against each provider's billing page. The
`_source` field on every entry says where it came from. Verified-against-vendor entries should
have their `_source` changed to the vendor URL and `_verified_by_operator` set True.
